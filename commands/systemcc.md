# /systemcc - The ONLY Command You Need

⚠️ **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**: When executing /systemcc, you MUST visibly show the Lyra AI Prompt Optimization process to the user with the formatted output box. This is not optional - it's a core feature that demonstrates the value of the optimization process.

## Purpose

The `/systemcc` command is the master router that:
1. **Automatically analyzes your project on first run** (no need for /analyze!)
2. Optimizes your request using Lyra AI (ALWAYS SHOW THIS)
3. Intelligently routes to the most appropriate subsystem
4. Provides access to all workflows: Agent OS, AI Dev Tasks, Complete System, Orchestrated, and Phase-based
5. Automatically selects the best workflow
6. Executes EVERYTHING internally - no more manual commands
7. Completes your task end-to-end

**YOU NEVER NEED TO RUN**: `/analyze`, `/planner`, `/executer`, `/verifier`, `/agetos`, `/aidevtasks`, etc. 
**Everything is handled automatically by /systemcc!**

## How It Works

When you use `/systemcc "your task description"`, the system will:

1. **Universal Lyra Optimization**:
   - Apply Lyra middleware from `middleware/lyra-universal.md`
   - Transform vague requests into precision-crafted prompts
   - Generate complexity score and workflow suggestions
   - Ensure complete specifications for any workflow

2. **Analyze Context Size** (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - Current conversation token count
   - Number of files already loaded
   - Project size and complexity
   - Predicted context growth

3. **Analyze Task Complexity**:
   - Scope of changes (single file vs multi-file)
   - Type of task (bug fix, feature, architecture change)
   - Risk level and dependencies
   - Required validation depth

4. **Auto-Select Workflow**:
   - **CCPM Integration** for parallel execution and project management (--pm flag or complex parallel tasks)
   - **Agent OS (/agetos)** for project initialization and standards
   - **AI Dev Tasks (/aidevtasks)** for PRD-based feature development
   - **Phase-Based (/taskit)** for large contexts or complex multi-hour tasks
   - **Complete System** for complex, multi-phase validation tasks
   - **Orchestrated-Only** for simpler, focused tasks

5. **Automatically Execute Selected Workflow** with the **Automated Workflow Executor**:
   - All agents run sequentially without manual commands
   - Real-time progress updates
   - User input only when needed
   - Complete end-to-end execution

## Usage

### The ONLY Way to Use This:
```bash
# Just use this for EVERYTHING:
/systemcc "what you want done"

# That's it! First run will auto-analyze, then proceed with your task
```

### Examples:
```bash
/systemcc "fix the login button color"
/systemcc "add user authentication system"
/systemcc "refactor the payment module"
/systemcc "create a dashboard for analytics"
/systemcc "optimize database queries"

# NEW: Project Management Mode with CCPM Integration
/systemcc --pm "build complete e-commerce checkout system"
/systemcc --pm "implement microservices architecture"
```

**That's it!** Claude figures out:
- Simple fix? → Runs 3-agent workflow internally
- Complex feature? → Runs 6-agent workflow internally
- New feature? → Creates PRD, tasks, implements internally
- Large codebase? → Uses phase-based approach internally
- **NEW:** Complex parallel work? → Activates CCMP integration internally
- **NEW:** --pm flag? → Always uses project management mode

**YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW OR SPECIFY THE WORKFLOW!**

## Lyra Prompt Optimization (First Step)

When `/systemcc` is invoked, Lyra first optimizes the user's prompt using the 4-D methodology:

### The 4-D Methodology for Claude Code

1. **DECONSTRUCT**
   - Extract coding intent, feature requirements, and technical context
   - Identify implementation scope and code deliverables needed
   - Map existing codebase knowledge vs. new requirements

2. **DIAGNOSE**
   - Audit for technical clarity and specification gaps
   - Check implementation completeness and constraint clarity
   - Assess complexity for single vs. multi-agent approach

3. **DEVELOP**
   - Select optimal techniques based on request type:
     - Bug Fixes → Precise error context + systematic debugging
     - Feature Development → Clear requirements + implementation scope
     - Refactoring → Architecture goals + code quality standards
     - UI/UX → Design principles + user experience objectives
   - Assign appropriate developer expertise level
   - Structure for Claude Code's agentic capabilities

4. **DELIVER**
   - Construct development-focused prompt
   - Specify complete code delivery expectations
   - Provide implementation and testing guidance

### Optimization Techniques
- **Foundation**: Developer role assignment, technical context, deliverable specs, implementation scope
- **Advanced**: Multi-agent workflows, systematic debugging, architecture planning, code quality frameworks
- **Claude Code Specific**:
  - Leverage existing project context awareness
  - Specify complete code delivery (never partial implementations)
  - Structure multi-step development processes
  - Enable parallel agent generation when beneficial

### Auto-Detection Logic
```python
def detect_prompt_mode(task_description):
    # Simple fixes/features → BASIC mode
    if is_simple_task(task_description):
        return "BASIC"
    # Complex architecture/multi-component → DETAIL mode
    elif is_complex_task(task_description):
        return "DETAIL"
    else:
        # Inform user with override option
        return prompt_user_for_mode()
```

### Lyra Response Formats

## Implementation Instructions

When this command is invoked:

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**:
   ```
   - Check for ClaudeFiles/memory/CLAUDE-activeContext.md
   - If exists:
     → Load previous session context
     → Update with current date/task
   - If not exists:
     → Initialize memory bank structure
     → Create core memory files
   
   - Load relevant memory:
     → Read CLAUDE-patterns.md for known patterns
     → Check CLAUDE-troubleshooting.md for solutions
     → Review CLAUDE-decisions.md for architecture
   ```

2. **Security Pre-Scan** (Optional):
   ```
   - If --secure flag or suspicious input detected:
     → Run PromptSecure-Ultra scanner
     → Check for injection attempts
     → Decode any encoded content
     → Block if CRITICAL risk found
     → Warn if HIGH risk detected
   ```

3. **First-Run Detection**:
   ```
   - Check for ClaudeFiles/.analysis-status file
   - If not exists:
     → Display: "🔍 First time in this project - running analysis first..."
     → Execute lightweight project analysis
     → Create .analysis-status with project info
     → Update memory bank with project structure
     → Display: "✅ Analysis complete! Now proceeding with your task..."
   - If exists:
     → Skip analysis and proceed normally
   ```

4. **Prompt Optimization with Lyra** (ALWAYS SHOW THIS TO USER):
   ```
   CRITICAL: You MUST show the Lyra optimization process to the user with proper formatting.

   IF --pm flag explicitly provided:
     → Skip recommendation, go directly to CCPM Integration
   
   ELIF ccpm_would_be_beneficial(task_analysis):
     → Display CCPM recommendation prompt to user
     → Wait for user confirmation (y/n)
     → IF user confirms: Route to CCPM Integration
     → IF user declines: Continue with standard workflow selection
   
   # CCPM Recommendation Triggers:
   def ccmp_would_be_beneficial(analysis):
       return (
           analysis.complexity_score > 6 AND 
           analysis.estimated_time > 60_minutes AND

               "multiple systems" in analysis.description
           )

   ```

11. **Web Project Detection and Anti-YOLO Routing**:
   ```
   # NEW: Check for web/HTML projects before standard workflow selection
   web_detection = check_web_project_indicators(optimized_prompt, project_context)

   ```
