# CLAUDE.md - Claude Agent System Configuration

This project uses the Claude Agent System with 10/10 code quality standards, advanced decision engines, and persistent memory.

## THE ONLY COMMAND YOU NEED

```bash
/systemcc "describe what you want to do"
```

The system automatically:
- üîç Analyzes your codebase with 5-dimensional scoring
- üéØ Optimizes your request with Lyra AI intelligence
- üß† Selects optimal workflow using advanced decision engines
- ‚ö° Executes everything with comprehensive error handling
- üíæ Learns and remembers patterns across sessions
- üõ°Ô∏è Maintains 10/10 code quality with robust validation

## Intelligent Decision System

The enhanced decision engine uses:
- **Technical Complexity Analysis** - Pattern-based complexity scoring
- **Scope Impact Assessment** - Multi-dimensional scope evaluation  
- **Risk Factor Detection** - Comprehensive risk analysis
- **Context Load Management** - Smart context growth prediction
- **Time Pressure Recognition** - Urgency-aware workflow selection

Workflow selection:
- **Simple fixes** ‚Üí Streamlined 3-agent workflow (low complexity/risk)
- **Complex features** ‚Üí Complete 6-agent validation (high complexity/risk)
- **Large codebases** ‚Üí Phase-based execution (high context load)
- **Feature development** ‚Üí PRD-based structured approach
- **Critical tasks** ‚Üí Enhanced validation with comprehensive testing

## Memory Bank System

Your project now has persistent memory in `ClaudeFiles/memory/`:
- **activeContext.md** - Current session state
- **patterns.md** - Code conventions and patterns
- **decisions.md** - Architecture decisions
- **troubleshooting.md** - Solutions database

## File Organization

All Claude-generated files are organized in `ClaudeFiles/`:
- `documentation/` - All documentation
- `tests/` - Test results and bug reports
- `workflows/` - Task plans and summaries
- `memory/` - Persistent learning system
- `temp/` - Temporary working files

## Quality Assurance System

The system maintains 10/10 code quality through:
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive parameter validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling** - Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- **Performance Optimization** - Early termination and caching strategies
- **Constants Management** - Centralized configuration system
- **Logging Integration** - Debug and error logging for transparency
- **Type Safety** - Enhanced type validation and conversion

## Available Commands

- `/systemcc` - Universal entry point with intelligent routing (ALL YOU NEED)
- `/help` - Show all available commands
- `/analyzecc` - Manual project re-analysis (rarely needed)

## Advanced Features

### Decision Engine Transparency
- Real-time workflow selection reasoning
- 5-dimensional task analysis scoring
- Alternative workflow suggestions with confidence levels
- Performance metrics and optimization feedback

### Quality Standards
- All code changes validated for syntax and logic
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Performance-optimized with early termination strategies
- Production-ready robustness and reliability

## Project-Specific Configuration

Add your project-specific guidelines below:

### Code Style Preferences
- [Your coding standards will be learned and enforced automatically]

### Testing Requirements  
- [Test commands will be detected and validated automatically]

### Build Commands
- [Build/lint commands will be configured with quality checks]

# Claude Agent System - Quick Start (10/10 Code Quality)

## Primary Command

Just use: `/systemcc "describe what you want to do"`

The enhanced system automatically:
1. **5-Dimensional Analysis** - Evaluates technical complexity, scope impact, risk factors, context load, and time pressure
2. **Intelligent Routing** - Selects optimal workflow based on sophisticated decision algorithms
3. **Quality Assurance** - Validates all inputs, handles errors gracefully, and maintains production standards
4. **Performance Optimization** - Uses early termination, caching, and efficient pattern matching
5. **Transparent Reasoning** - Provides detailed decision explanations and alternative suggestions

## Examples

```bash
# Simple fix (auto-detects low complexity/risk)
/systemcc "fix typo in login page"

# Complex feature (auto-detects high complexity, triggers comprehensive validation)
/systemcc "implement user authentication with OAuth"

# Large refactoring (auto-detects high context load, uses phase-based execution)
/systemcc "refactor all API endpoints to use new pattern"

# Critical task (auto-detects risk factors, uses enhanced validation)
/systemcc "urgent: fix production database connection issue"
```

## Intelligent Features

### Decision Engine Transparency
- Real-time scoring across 5 dimensions
- Confidence levels and alternative workflow suggestions  
- Performance metrics and optimization feedback
- Detailed reasoning for all workflow selections

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Performance-optimized execution with early termination
- Production-ready robustness and reliability

## Auto-Adaptation

- `/analyzecc` - Deep project analysis with quality standards
  - Auto-detects tech stack with enhanced pattern recognition
  - Configures quality checks and validation rules
  - Updates all commands with optimized parameters

## Manual Commands (Power Users)

- `/taskit` - Force phase-based execution with quality validation
- `/orchestrated` - Force streamlined workflow with error handling
- `/planner` - Start complete system with comprehensive validation
- `/help` - Show enhanced command system

## Advanced Context Management

The system uses intelligent context load prediction:
- Monitors token usage and file complexity in real-time
- Predicts context growth using statistical models
- Automatically switches to phase-based execution when needed
- Maintains optimal performance through smart resource management
